//! Acquisition of one complete core-family input battery.
//!
//! [`super::evaluate_core`] decides; this module only gathers. Every compiled
//! declaration produces exactly one observation, in compiled order, whether or
//! not its provider could measure. An arm this build cannot observe crosses as
//! an explicit non-completion state carrying its own recovery, so a missing
//! provider is visible in the report instead of being an omitted row.
//!
//! Two arms declare exact `git` argument vectors. Acquisition avoids them only
//! when captured repository state proves the same clean result; otherwise they
//! run while the source is captured under the contract's process bounds, and
//! every process failure becomes typed evidence rather than an acquisition
//! error. The only failures that refuse outright are the ones that would leave
//! the battery incomplete: an unreadable selected tree and a malformed arm.
//!
//! Acquisition is handed no repository. Every arm reads either the immutable
//! selected tree or an observation the capture already took, so a repository
//! mutated or swapped after capture has nothing left to reach: there is no
//! later state that can cross into a report under the captured digest.
