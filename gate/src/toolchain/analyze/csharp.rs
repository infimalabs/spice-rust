//! What the C# unused-member arm may accuse, and what it withdraws unnamed.
//!
//! The walk is short and the exceptions are not. Which members are even
//! candidates, which silence about access really means private, and which
//! absences must be withdrawn rather than reported are each a rule about C#
//! itself, and together they outgrew the file every arm shares. The vocabulary
//! the arms have in common stays in [`super`]; only this reasoning lives here.
