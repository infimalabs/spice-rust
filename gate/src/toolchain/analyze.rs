//! Compiled analyses for the toolchain arms this build answers itself.
//!
//! Every declared analysis enters through this module: the formatter check,
//! native and app compilers, workstation-path and prose scanners,
//! JavaScript and C# declaration/reference analyses, Python typecheck, and the
//! two environment scanners. Each reports only what it observed, and
//! [`super::measure_toolchain`] remains the sole authority that admits it.
//!
//! Each declaration records its exclusions as English sentences and its
//! includes as globs. Those strings are the retained evidence and the
//! predicates here are the compiled form of the same rules, so every rule is
//! written once in this module and the two spellings are proven equal in tests.
//!
//! The environment law is large enough to live on its own in
//! [`super::environment`]. This module still owns which paths the two
//! environment arms select and which outcome they earn; that module owns only
//! what one line of one language family says about the environment.
//!
//! The C# unused-member analysis lives in [`csharp`] for the same reason. Its
//! whole difficulty is which absences it may accuse and which it must withdraw
//! unnamed, and that argument reads better beside itself than interleaved with
//! arms that share none of it.
