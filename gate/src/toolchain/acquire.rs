//! Acquisition of one complete toolchain-family observation battery.
//!
//! [`super::measure_toolchain`] validates, orders, and canonicalizes; this
//! module only observes. Every declaration produces exactly one
//! [`ArmObservation`], in compiled order, whether or not this build can analyze
//! it. Every declaration naming a compiled analysis routes to
//! [`super::analyze`];
//! the rest cross as [`ArmOutcome::Unsupported`], which is neither a pass nor a
//! skip, so an unmeasured tree is never admitted by silence.
//!
//! The rim directory, the executable search path, and the selected changes are
//! all ambient configuration. Each is captured at the binary rim and handed in
//! whole rather than read back from the process or the repository here, so two
//! machines cannot silently resolve two different programs or scan two
//! different sets. Reading nothing back is also why a relative rim directory is
//! refused by [`RimCapture::new`] instead of resolved there: resolving it would
//! read the one piece of process state this module declines to consult.
//!
//! A declared program is probed exactly once, at one absolute path, and the
//! probe answers with one of three observations: not found, found and not
//! identifiable, or identified at exactly what it printed. The middle one is
//! why the first two are separate: a tool that is present and broken is a
//! different fact about this machine than a tool that was never installed, and
//! collapsing them would send an operator looking for the wrong thing.
//!
//! One state the family vocabulary cannot express: an arm whose declared tools
//! include both an unusable program and a resolved one at the wrong version.
//! `ToolUnavailable` requires every identified program to be exact and
//! `UnsupportedVersion` requires every program to be identified, so acquisition
//! reports the unusable program and lets [`super::measure_toolchain`] refuse the
//! incoherent pair loudly rather than inventing a third reading.
