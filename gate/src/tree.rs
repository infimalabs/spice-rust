//! Immutable Git tree selection for gate runs.
//!
//! A gate never measures the checkout. The staged selector captures one parsed
//! index plus the exact `HEAD` tree that gives staged renames their lineage,
//! while a revision selector resolves one immutable commit identity. Both
//! sources pass through the same path, mode, object, and materialization checks
//! before a private read-only root is returned to the caller, named together
//! with the repository it was taken from so that an arm which must observe that
//! repository cannot be pointed at a different one.
//!
//! Each materialization is a real directory of real bytes below the temporary
//! directory. Retained staged slots preserve unchanged source timestamps.
//! Every source-consuming child inherits the slot's lock description, so a
//! dropped or killed gate cannot expose its compiler's source to a refill.
//! Ephemeral roots are reclaimed only when no consumer holds their lock;
//! abandoned-workspace recovery applies the same kernel possession check.
