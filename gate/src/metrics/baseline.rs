//! The committed bytes a per-file delta is measured against.
//!
//! A regression is content that is in a file now and was not in the same file
//! in the commit the pending one is being written on top of. The committed side
//! is therefore half the measurement, not an optimization: a scan handed no
//! baseline reports everything a file already had as newly introduced, which is
//! why the arm reported the missing input rather than measuring until this
//! existed.
//!
//! The pending commit has as many parents as `HEAD` plus `MERGE_HEAD`, and all
//! of them are read. Comparing against the first parent alone would report every
//! file the second parent brings in as newly written by the merging lane, which
//! is the one thing a merge demonstrably did not do. Each current file is
//! therefore measured against the parent that carries it verbatim when one does,
//! and against the nearest parent that carries the path at all otherwise. If no
//! parent carries the path, the merge base is the last baseline: both sides can
//! delete a file that the merge then restores, and treating that as a new path
//! would erase the delta the shared history still supplies.
//!
//! File shape has one additional authorship source: Git's exact tree for an
//! exit-zero clean merge. Disjoint parent edits can synthesize bytes neither
//! parent carries, and charging that automatic result to the merge receiver can
//! fail a limit both parents respected. Only an exact blob match is inherited;
//! a conflict, unavailable result, or one receiver-authored byte is measured.
//!
//! The guarantee is for files a merge left alone, and it stops there. A file the
//! merging lane edited matches no parent, so it is measured against the nearest
//! one and may report content the other side had already committed. That lane is
//! presenting an edited file as its own work, and answering otherwise would mean
//! asking every parent separately and calling introduced only what none of them
//! held — a wider contract than a merge needs to be able to land.
//!
//! The bytes are read once, in the moment the battery source is captured, and
//! retained for the run. `HEAD` moves. A read deferred to the moment the arm
//! runs would compare against a commit the report never names, and two paths in
//! one arm could be compared against two different commits.
//!
//! Only selected source classes and exact rim-change paths are read. The whole
//! committed tree is walked either way, but unrelated prose, fixtures, and
//! images are never retained. Suffix classes serve arms whose jurisdiction has
//! one; exact paths serve arms such as local-paths that select every changed
//! regular file and therefore cannot name extensionless inputs as a class.
