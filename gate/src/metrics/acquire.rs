//! Acquisition of the complete four-arm structural metric family.
//!
//! The family is acquired in full or not at all, and "in full" means four arms
//! that each carry one explicit state per declared metric. An arm whose input
//! this build cannot reach reports [`EvidenceState::Unavailable`] naming the
//! exact missing input, because the alternative — omitting the arm, or refusing
//! the whole family — spends four declared measurements to say one thing about
//! whichever of them is least ready.
