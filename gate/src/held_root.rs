//! A directory one run owns for its own use, and the lock that says who owns it.
//!
//! Two surfaces in this crate materialize a scratch directory and hold it for
//! the length of a run: the compiling analysis arms, which resolve a fixed
//! sibling of the selected tree, and gate tree selection, which mints a private
//! workspace below the temporary directory. Both meet the same problem. A
//! directory left behind by a run that was killed before its own teardown is
//! indistinguishable, by looking at it, from a directory a live run is writing
//! into right now. A caller that could see only the directory has to treat both
//! alike -- reclaim both and it deletes live work, refuse both and every killed
//! run leaves wreckage an operator must clear by hand.
//!
//! What tells them apart is an advisory lock at `<root>.lock`, held for the life
//! of the directory, and the invariant is that **a caller removes a held root
//! only while it possesses that root's lock**. [`remove_held_root`] takes a
//! [`Possession`] rather than a path alone, so the invariant is carried by the
//! signature and a removal cannot be spelled without the lock in hand, and
//! [`hold`] is one way to obtain one. Contention is therefore not a removal that
//! gets refused; it is a removal that never becomes reachable, because a
//! contended caller returns before it owns anything to tear down.
//!
//! `flock` grants per-open-file-description, so a second acquisition contends
//! even from inside this process; that is what lets a fixture hold a root and
//! drive the decision directly rather than having to lose a race to observe it.
//!
//! The lock is kept beside the root rather than inside it, so removing the root
//! cannot remove the evidence that it was held. Each caller passes its own label
//! and lock name, so every refusal names the surface the operator ran.
