/// A refusal the formatter cannot explain is retained with the code it gave.
///
/// [`measure_toolchain`] admits an exit code only beside `NonzeroAnalysis` and
/// demands one there, so an analysis that reports the outcome without the code
/// is refused at admission rather than at the call. The captured tree here has
/// Rust sources and no manifest, which is a refusal about the tree rather than
/// about any one file, so the formatter names no differing file.
///
/// The code ships twice, once as a field and once inside the sentence, and both
/// spellings are held to each other. A reader shown a sentence naming one code
/// beside a field carrying another has been handed an invented number.
