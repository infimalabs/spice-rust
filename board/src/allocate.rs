//! The one writer that mints a claim.
//!
//! Every claim the port commits in production is minted here. The resident's
//! claim command assembles the transaction around this writer -- selection,
//! residency admission, the change guard that re-reads the head set inside the
//! write, and the command receipt all live with the command that needs them --
//! and calls in to record the claim itself. Keeping the lifecycle write in one
//! place is what stops a field added to a claim from reaching one caller and
//! not another.
