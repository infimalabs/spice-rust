//! Deterministic recent-window TF-IDF similarity between task statements,
//! tempered by how ordinary each term is in lane conversation.
//!
//! Documents use lowercase alphabetic terms from authored task fields. Digit
//! runs, short words, and common English filler are inert; `-ies` plurals and
//! long-stem `-ie` singulars fold to `-y`, then one ordinary trailing `s` is
//! folded. Workflow vocabulary such as claim, Design, phase, review, verdict,
//! propose, done, todo, and flow stays subject matter: it is never stopped
//! globally, and is left to fitted inverse document frequency over the most
//! recently revised statements and to the conversation [`Background`]. A
//! term's weight is logarithmic term frequency times statement inverse
//! document frequency times the [`CONVERSATION_RARITY_EXPONENT`] power of its
//! conversation inverse document frequency normalized by an unseen term's, so
//! a term in every held message keeps about a third of its weight and an empty
//! background is plain statement TF-IDF. L2-normalized sparse vectors then
//! produce one cosine score.
//!
//! Term counts are canonical and fit-independent. A [`Prepared`] vector is a
//! derived cache weighted under one fitted [`Generation`]; two vectors compare
//! only when they share it. Every cache is process-scoped, so a changed fold or
//! stop word takes effect with the binary that carries it. Every matcher (Design
//! awareness, the wake and `task next` match, and claim overlap) takes its fit
//! and statement vectors from the one shared [`MatchCache`], which counts the
//! background only when the statement window refits.
