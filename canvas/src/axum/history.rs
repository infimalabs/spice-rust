//! Resident-wide bounds on durable history reads.

//! Every socket's history requests cross one surface. At most

//! order, so a second Canvas queues behind the first rather than multiplying

//! unanswered at all; a client pages one cursor per lane at a time, so only a
//! surface saturated far beyond any team's lanes refuses one.
