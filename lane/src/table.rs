//! Lane identity, worktree, occupant, and epoch, reduced from facts.
//!
//! The table is the durable half of a seat. A lane is created once with the
//! capability and worktree it stays bound to; occupants then arrive, end, and
//! are succeeded beneath that identity, each one recorded in the lineage so a
//! successor can always name what it descends from.
//!
//! Exactly one occupant sits in a seat at a time. That is the whole point of a
//! seat, so a start against an occupied lane is refused rather than overwriting
//! the occupant already there — two supervisors believing they own the same
//! lane is the failure this crate exists to prevent.
//!
//! Reduction is total and ordered: the same facts read in the same order always
//! produce the same table, and a fact naming a lane that was never seated is
//! refused instead of quietly creating one.
