//! The life policy a seat is supervised under.

//! A seat is always under exactly one of three policies. Under [`Steer`] the
//! occupant is directed and waits to be told; under [`Drive`] it works the
//! queue on its own; under [`Drain`] it is finishing and will not be re-seated.
//! The set is closed because a fourth policy would be a fourth answer to
//! "should this seat be refilled", and that question admits only these three.
//!
//! Transitions are guarded rather than free. Steering and driving exchange
//! freely, both may begin draining, and draining is where a policy ends: a
//! seat that has begun finishing does not return to work, because the work it
//! would return to has already been handed on.
