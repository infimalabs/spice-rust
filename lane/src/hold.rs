//! Pausing re-seating when a seat keeps killing its occupants.
//!
//! An occupant that dies young dies before it did any work, so re-seating it
//! immediately produces another young death and a lane that spends its whole
//! life starting. After enough of them in a row the seat is held: re-seating
//! stops until an operator wakes it or the hold reaches its deadline.
//!
//! An occupant whose last word was a vendor failure holds the seat at once.
//! The vendor refused the turn the seat resumes into, so the next occupant
//! resumes into the same refusal, and counting those exits as young deaths
//! would only re-seat the refusal until the run was long enough to notice.
//!
//! A hold is a fact, not a log line. [`LaneHeld`] carries the evidence and the
//! deadline it was taken under and [`LaneResumed`] carries what released it, so
//! the reason a lane stopped filling is answerable from the journal instead of
//! from whatever the supervisor happened to print.
//!
//! Youth and now both arrive from the caller. This module compares the
//! deadlines it was handed and never reads a clock, so a held lane replays to
//! the same hold.
