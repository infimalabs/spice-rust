//! What one lane has been doing lately.
//!
//! A trace is a fixed window of wall time ending at the instant it is drawn,
//! shared by every composer rail so neighbours compare honestly; activity moves
//! left as time passes and leaves once it is a whole window old. Work becomes
//! one curve per kind, reasoning, tool, and prose, whose height is that kind's
//! recent rate on one fixed scale; lifecycle activity becomes markers. The
//! curves are sampled at evenly spaced instants through a kernel that slides
//! with time, so a redraw moves them smoothly instead of jumping between
//! buckets. Positions and levels are fractions; the browser owns every pixel
//! except the curve's path command, built here from its pixel points so its
//! floor rule is checked natively. Intervals the lane was off become gaps in
//! its rail once they last at least the spacing between two samples.
