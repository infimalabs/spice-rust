//! Which unsatisfied dependencies only the operator can move.
//!
//! A dependency on work an agent can claim or is already working resolves
//! organically, so it is an ordinary wait. A lapsed claim and a passive Design
//! are transparent: the task keeps its own stale or passive standing, while its
//! underlying gate decides the dependency path, so an open Design gathering
//! input never reads as a wall. A chain is a wall only when every path forward
//! needs the operator: a deferral, an internal parked row, a cycle, a
//! prerequisite that can never complete, or an environment requirement only the
//! operator can satisfy.
