//! Operator form input composed into the fields a client action carries.
//!
//! Every other floor faces inward, holding what the resident said. This one
//! faces the other way: it is the only place where text an operator typed
//! becomes a request, and so the only place that can refuse one. A refusal
//! here is operator-facing prose rather than a log line, because the form it
//! came from has a button, and a button that does nothing and says nothing is
//! indistinguishable from a dead control or a lost request.
//!
//! The browser module that owns the forms compiles only for wasm32, so no
//! native test can reach a decision made inside a `Callback`. Keeping the
//! decisions here instead means each refusal is reachable from an ordinary
//! test on any target, and the callback is left with nothing to do but render
//! what it is handed.
