//! Lane commands the operator issues from one Dash member: the one in flight,
//! and how the last one settled.
//!
//! A member runs at most one such command at a time. Its answer settles the
//! exact request it carries, so a late answer to a command abandoned by a
//! reconnect cannot clear or refuse a newer one. Every reservation ends in a
//! settlement, an abandoned one included, so whatever reports the command in
//! flight always learns how it ended.
