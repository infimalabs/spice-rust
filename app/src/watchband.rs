//! The band of lane standings that sits above the feed.
//!
//! One lane's standing is spread across three answers the resident sends
//! separately: the lane table says where it runs and what vendor drives it,
//! the inbox says what direction is waiting for it, and the board says which
//! task it currently holds and how long it has held it. This module performs
//! that join and nothing else, so the arithmetic behind "seated 4m, 2 pending,
//! MOSAIC-1kKQXgDd, review" is reachable from an ordinary native test rather
//! than only from a browser.
//!
//! Every field here is carried by an answer. Nothing is a friendly stand-in
//! the app invented: a lane is named by the identity the resident gave it, and
//! elapsed time comes from the lease, which is the only clock the board hands
//! a task. A field the reference design shows and the wire does not carry is
//! therefore absent here rather than approximated.
