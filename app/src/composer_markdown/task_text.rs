//! Authored task text: descriptions, acceptance criteria, observations, and

//! Task text is Markdown written by operators and agents with the same intent
//! as message prose, so it renders in the one message dialect: math, Mermaid
//! fences, footnotes, tables, images, and the same sanitization. The detail
//! surface owns only two differences: headings nest under its own section
//! headings, and only handles that resolve on the admitted board become task
//! chips, so no chip leads nowhere.
