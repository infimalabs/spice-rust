//! What one rendered app card may hand the voice backend.
//!
//! The backend speaks whatever it is given, so deciding what is speakable
//! belongs on this side of it. A card the operator can read is the only
//! source: a compaction boundary renders as a rule and a label, and a tool
//! card renders as its image, so neither has words to say even though both
//! carry text on the wire. Speaking that text reads retained context nobody
//! can see back to the room.
//!
//! Inside a card the agent's own sentences are speakable and quoted lines are
//! not, because a reply that quotes an operator back would otherwise voice the
//! operator as the agent. Fenced code is shown to be read rather than heard,
//! and a quote or a fence ends the segment around it instead of joining the
//! sentences on either side.
//!
//! Automatic narration speaks only a card's edge segments: the first and last
//! meaningful paragraphs of the whole card, the same selection the resident
//! makes for Speak-mode final answers, so one long message cannot hold the
//! single global voice for minutes. List items are detail to read on the card:
//! a card that opens with a list speaks that list's first item, and a closing
//! list is never voiced. Playback the operator asked for keeps every visible
//! segment.
