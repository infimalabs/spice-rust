# Profile app latency in Firefox

The app exposes opt-in User Timing diagnostics without changing route parsing.
Open the ordinary app URL, run
`sessionStorage.setItem("spice:app-trace", "1"); location.reload()` in its
developer console, and leave that tab open for the capture. A traced page
installs `window.__spiceAppTrace`; an ordinary page does not attach the
native input listeners or create timing entries.

Build the current browser body with `spice dev xtask -- app` and serve that
generation through the development resident. Then capture two short runs of the
same interaction:

1. Open `about:profiling` in Firefox, select the **Web Developer** preset, and
   start the profiler.
2. In the traced app tab, run `window.__spiceAppTrace.clear()` in the
   developer console immediately before the scenario.
3. Perform one fixed scenario: use the same loaded board, focus the same
   composer, enter or dictate the same text, and trigger the same resident
   update. Keep the capture short enough that the entire interaction is easy to
   inspect.
4. For the loaded comparison, start
   `spice dev cargo -- check --locked -p spice` in another terminal and perform
   the scenario while that real compile is active. Stop and save the profile.
5. Wait for the command and all compiler processes to exit. Clear the app
   trace, repeat the identical scenario without compilation, then stop and save
   the settled profile.
6. In each Firefox profile, use the Marker Chart and filter for
   `spice.app.`. Compare those markers on the app content main thread
   against DOM events, task scheduling gaps, style recalculation, layout, and
   paint. Retain the profile URLs or exported profiles with the investigation
   notes.

Marker names carry only bounded structural metadata:

| Marker | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| `trace.start` | App source/build identity for the capture. |
| `frame.received`, `frame.decode.*` | Incoming frame size and browser-side decode/admission work. |
| `state.apply.*`, `state.publish` | Runtime mutation and the Yew publication that schedules rendering. |
| `render.app` | Rust/Yew virtual-DOM construction with the retained card count. |
| `layout.measure` | Mosaic DOM measurement, including card count and measured width. |
| `composer.textarea.mount`, `composer.textarea.unmount` | Native textarea instance lifetime, focus, and selection. A changed instance during one interaction is a remount. |
| `composer.input`, `composer.keydown` | Native event kind, composition state, focus, and selection without draft text. |

The browser retains a bounded window of app diagnostic records, dropping the
oldest first. `window.__spiceAppTrace.clear()` removes only entries owned by
the current app trace. Run
`sessionStorage.removeItem("spice:app-trace"); location.reload()` to disable
collection.

Interpret ordering conservatively. `render.app` ends when Rust finishes
building Yew nodes, not when the DOM is committed or painted.
`layout.measure` covers synchronous Mosaic DOM reads and writes, but a later
paint must be established from Firefox's own markers. A DOM `beforeinput` or
`input` marker is not the start of speech recognition. The trace intentionally
has no animation-frame marker: an animation-frame callback would show callback
eligibility, not presentation.
