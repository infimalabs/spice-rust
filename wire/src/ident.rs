//! Canonical identity spellings shared by every crossing type.
//!
//! WIRE fixes one spelling per durable identity. UUIDs are lower-case
//! `8-4-4-4-12`; instants are RFC3339 UTC with millisecond precision and a
//! trailing `Z`. The `uuid` and `jiff` crates own the underlying primitives,
//! so no leaf chooses its own; these newtypes add only the spelling law,
//! which those crates deliberately do not enforce.
//!
//! # Instants narrow precision and refuse unspellable years
//!
//! An [`Instant`] holds exactly the resolution its spelling carries, because
//! [`Instant::new`] floors to milliseconds instead of storing the sharper
//! timestamp it was handed. Equal wire bytes therefore imply equal values, and
//! `Ord` and `Hash` agree with what `Display` renders.
//!
//! Sharper input is narrowed because `new` is how a clock reading becomes
//! wire-shaped, and clocks normally carry more precision than the wire. Years
//! outside the fixed-width `YYYY` schema are different: no admitted spelling
//! can represent them, so construction refuses them instead of creating a
//! value that can encode but never decode. [`FromStr`] likewise rejects a
//! sharper or extended-year spelling outright rather than repairing it.
//!
//! The narrowing floors toward negative infinity, matching the printer.
//! Truncating toward zero — which is what `Timestamp::as_millisecond` and
//! `RoundMode::Trunc` both do — disagrees with the rendered spelling before
//! 1970: `1969-12-31T23:59:59.999999Z` renders `.999Z` but truncates up to
//! `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`, reintroducing this very defect in a narrower range.
