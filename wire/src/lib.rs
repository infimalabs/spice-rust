//! The crossing types.
//!
//! One current DTO schema crosses the socket, rests in the journal, and
//! compiles into the browser app. This crate owns those types and the one
//! decoder every consumer uses.
//!
//! The socket, journal, and browser do not carry three compatibility systems:
//! the socket admits the current version only, the journal runs one forward
//! migration at open, and the browser admits its independent app clock from
//! authenticated HTTP metadata before decoding the strict bootstrap body or
//! opening the socket.
//!
//! # Absent optional fields are omitted
//!
//! Every crossing `Option<T>` has one document spelling for absence: the key
//! is omitted. A present key must carry a `T`; explicit `null` is refused so
//! two different documents cannot decode to the same DTO. Authors enforce the
//! rule with `default`, `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`, and
//! `deserialize_with = "crate::optional::present"` on every optional field.
//!
//! # The vocabularies are closed, so they stay enumerable
//!
//! [`CommandKind`], [`FactKind`], [`Witness`], [`WitnessKind`], and
//! [`WitnessClass`] each name a closed set, and none of them is
//! `#[non_exhaustive]`. `WitnessKind` classifies command predicates;
//! `WitnessClass` classifies authoritative witness heads. That
//! attribute protects consumers compiled against an older release of a
//! published crate, and this crate has no such consumer: the socket admits the
//! current version only, the journal runs one forward migration at open, and
//! the browser app is compiled from this crate into the binary that owns the
//! socket. Every consumer recompiles from this source.
//!
//! What the attribute costs is what decides it. Marking these enums
//! non-exhaustive obliges every fold, producer, and view outside this crate to
//! carry a wildcard arm, which turns "a kind was added" from a build failure
//! naming the unhandled variant into a value that quietly takes the default
//! branch. Exhaustive matching is the strongest enforcement a closed vocabulary
//! can have, and these sets are declared closed precisely so they can have it.
