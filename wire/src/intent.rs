//! Command intent and its answer: the body a caller sends and the body it
//! gets back.
//!
//! WIRE fixes one rule here: the discriminant selects the body DTO, witness
//! schema, transition, and reply DTO together. The witness half already lives
//! in the registry; this module owns the other two, so every command kind
//! names exactly one intent and one answer.
//!
//! Mutation bodies carry caller intent only; the commit door assigns actor,
//! lane, epoch, journal position and resulting fact envelopes. Read bodies may
//! name bounds and previously observed pins without establishing that authority.
//!
//! Several kinds share one shape on purpose. Freeing and lapsing a claim both
//! name a task and nothing else, so they share
//! [`TaskRef`](crate::intent::TaskRef); renewal has its own shape because it
//! also names the requested lease duration.

// That link is crate-rooted, not bare, and has to stay that way. This module is
// documented from two places: `pub mod intent;` in `lib.rs` carries an outer
// comment as well, and rustdoc resolves the merged text in the scope that
// declaration sits in — the crate root, where a bare `TaskRef` is not in scope
// precisely because that outer comment's subject is that this module is
// deliberately not re-exported flat.
