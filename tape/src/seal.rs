//! Rotation of plaintext into indexed, immutable seekable archives.
//!
//! Sealing one member is three separable steps over a staged file: prepare
//! streams the plaintext into a [seekable Zstandard archive](crate::archive),
//! verify reopens the staged archive and the plaintext independently and
//! compares every decoded byte, and publish renames the verified archive into
//! place. None of the three touches the plaintext or the index, and a failure
//! in any of them removes only the staged file.
//!
//! A seal publishes in one order and that order is the crash contract: the
//! verified archive first, then the index that names it, then the removal of
//! the plaintext it was made from. Every prefix of that order is recoverable.
//! Dying before the archive is published leaves at most a staged file, which
//! the next seal removes. Dying between the archive and the index leaves an
//! unreferenced archive beside plaintext that is still accepting appends;
//! readers never consult it, and the next seal replaces it. Dying between the
//! index and the removal leaves plaintext whose member the index already
//! names. Readers prefer that plaintext, and the next seal's recovery removes
//! it only after the current published archive is proven to reproduce it byte
//! for byte; a missing, unreadable or unfaithful archive is prepared again
//! first. Capture never recovers, because recovery verifies an archive.
//!
//! Plaintext is therefore never removed before the bytes it holds are
//! verifiably readable from somewhere else, and every step runs under the
//! writer lock, so no append can land in a member being sealed.
