//! The pre-action actuator: vendor asks, consent decides.
//!
//! A request's first arrival as [`wire::body::ConsentAsked`] leaves as exactly
//! one [`Outcome`], which carries the fact that records the decision. Reusing
//! its identity is refused before another fact or budget spend. The three
//! modules are the three things a decision needs: [`policy`] states which named
//! rule answers, [`budget`] bounds how many times a rule may grant before an
//! operator renews it, and [`pend`] holds what the operator must answer while
//! the lane keeps doing reversible work, then records the answer once given.
//!
//! No policy is decided anywhere else. `vendor` states the request and this
//! crate answers it, so the seat an operator configures is the seat that acts.
