//! One command for a point-in-time Darwin build that disturbs no other
//! worktree.
//!
//! `seal-darwin` seals this worktree's native proof runner at HEAD through
//! `dist/proof-runner/build.sh`, which binds it to this worktree's own
//! `proof.runner`, then stages the sealed `aarch64-apple-darwin` target and,
//! when asked, places the final executable under an output directory. Every
//! write lands in this worktree's `target/` and `dist/stage/`, its own
//! Git-directory configuration, or the named output directory. The
//! repository's installed appliance, its resident, the Git-common
//! configuration, and every other worktree are never touched, so lanes seal
//! independently and never inherit one another's runner.
