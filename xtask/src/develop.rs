//! One-command developer refresh of the repository-embedded Spice appliance.
//!
//! `spice dev xtask -- install` builds the current browser app and native tree,
//! republishes `.spice-install/bin/spice` through the digest-bound installer,
//! and restarts the resident with its exact live bind and access policy.
//!
//! The installer derives a refresh when a completed receipt names different
//! executable bytes, so a rebuilt tree needs nothing withdrawn: the install step
//! is `plan` then `apply`, and every destination is exchanged in place. What
//! this command adds over those two calls is the rest of the loop — building
//! the tree, and stopping and restarting the resident on its own endpoint.
//!
//! A refresh that fails after publishing rolls back by running the parked
//! previous executable's own `install` (plan, then apply by digest). Only that
//! release can publish its complete asset set: the skill, hooks, and wrapper the
//! in-process installer would write are compiled into this xtask build, not
//! read from the parked executable, and a resident refuses every lane launch
//! over a skill that is not its own.
//!
//! That loop only exists where Cargo, processes, and the installer do, so it
//! lives in [`native`] behind the wasm gate. The request, the report, and every
//! refusal stay published on every target so a caller compiled for wasm sees
//! the same [`refresh`] signature and one honest [`RefreshError::Unavailable`].
