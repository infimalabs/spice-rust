# Sealed Linux proof image

The `linux/amd64` proof environment: the immutable Rust base, pinned tooling,
required Rust targets, vendored registry sources, and the `wasm-opt` build
release proof uses. It runs with networking disabled and fresh Cargo home and
target mounts.

```sh
spice dev xtask -- proof-image build
spice dev xtask -- proof-image load target/proof-image/spice-proof-image.tar
spice dev xtask -- proof-image verify
```

`build` fingerprints the sorted external package identities in `Cargo.lock`,
passes that digest into the image's `org.spice.vendor-set` label, and refuses
unless inspection reports the same label. It writes the image archive with its
`.sha256` and `.identity` sidecars under `target/proof-image/` and refuses
unless the built identity matches `identity.txt`, the identity the release proof
contract records. `load` restores an archive on another Docker host from an
exact checkout of the same revision, verifying checksum and identity. `verify`
exercises build and restore as one release verification action.

Linux proof names an absolute Docker or Podman executable as
`proof.container`. Its one image-inspection admission compares identity,
platform, and the current worktree's canonical vendor-set digest before any app
or Rust compilation. A missing, substituted, or stale image refuses with
`spice dev xtask -- proof-image build`; replay never discovers this state from a
later Cargo failure. Admitted replay uses a read-only workspace, empty temporary
caches, and no network.

## Container invocations

Containers are a release exception, never a development prerequisite. Exactly
four production surfaces invoke one:

- `proof-image build` builds, inspects, self-checks with networking disabled,
  and saves the image. Native Darwin tools cannot replace it: its product is the
  Linux appliance whose architecture, filesystem, tool closure, and OCI identity
  the proof contract records.
- `proof-image load` only loads and inspects an archive, recovering the same
  artifact without a second chance for identity drift.
- [`proof/src/container.rs`](../../proof/src/container.rs) runs the
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` battery in the pinned image. The OCI boundary
  supplies the read-only workspace, network namespace, fresh cache mounts, exact
  platform, and one attested scratch owner. The Darwin target uses the
  [sealed native runner](../proof-runner/README.md) instead.
- `stage-target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` on a non-Linux host runs the native
  Linux `stage-target` in the pinned image, launched by
  [`proof/src/container/stage.rs`](../../proof/src/container/stage.rs). Such a
  host can neither link the musl release with a pinned linker nor execute it to
  read its version. The worktree and its Git common directory are read-only,
  `dist/stage` is the one writable worktree path, the Cargo home and target
  are fresh, and the network is disabled. A Linux host stages natively.

Both sealed containers also mount an empty, non-executable tmpfs at `/tmp`.
Nothing in the build is pointed at it (`TMPDIR` stays under the target
directory the image fixes); it exists for Rosetta, which translates the amd64
image on an arm64 Docker host and aborts any thread whose context it must back
with a temporary file there when that file cannot be created.

Any further production invocation must declare its constraint here.

## Cleanup

The build context under `target/proof-image/context` is rebuilt each time; the
archive, checksum, identity, and build log beside it are recovery evidence, and
deleting them forces another pinned `linux/amd64` build when the image goes
missing. Restore a missing image with `proof-image load` rather than
rebuilding. Never use a Docker system, image, volume, or builder prune as
worktree cleanup: they are daemon-wide and may destroy shared evidence.
