//! Directives as durable state: publication, presentation, disposition, and expiry.
//!
//! Operator steering is state, not a message that scrolled past. A directive is
//! appended once and then retires only through a typed disposition, so what a
//! lane still owes is a question about facts rather than about whether a
//! terminal happened to be watched.
//!
//! Silence changes the presentation of the published directive without changing
//! its identity. Each named transition is retained in the directive's audit,
//! while acknowledgment, refusal, cancellation, lapse, and recovery address the
//! same UUID and human key throughout.
//!
//! Everything here reduces facts into standing. It appends nothing: the command
//! door mints directives, the scanner mints retirements, and this decides what
//! those facts mean together — which is why replaying the same facts always
//! produces the same pending set.
