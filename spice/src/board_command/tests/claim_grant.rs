// refuse, the caller sees the first refusal only, and a seat that cannot be read
// is reported before a boundary that cannot be captured. Only `claim_source_
// boundary` needs the lane, so swapping `claim_git_boundary` ahead of
// `claim_residency` compiles and changes which refusal a caller receives while
// every other test stays green. These two tests pin both sides of that order.
//
// The fixture refuses at both steps for unrelated reasons rather than one shared
// one: the witness names the seat beside the actor's own, which only the seat
// read compares, and that seat's worktree is `/fixture`, which only the boundary
// resolves. So the order under test is a choice between two live refusals.

/// The reason carried by a refusal or a fault, whichever the step raised.

/// The two steps here raise different `Outcome` variants -- a lane mismatch is a
/// refusal the caller could have avoided, an unresolvable worktree is an
/// environment fault -- so matching on one variant would decide the answer
