//! Operator-decided terminal settlement of a task that need not be held.
//!
//! Withdrawal (`deleted`), closure (`completed`), and a Design's conclusion
//! (`completed`, done or collapsed) share one shape: the journal keeps the
//! statement, so each is a terminal workflow status rather than a removal. The
//! row stops being allocatable, stops blocking its dependents, and keeps its
//! history and its stated text readable.
//!
//! A live claim refuses each by default, because taking work away from a
//! lane mid-flight is a decision an operator makes deliberately, not one they
//! discover afterwards. `force_claimed` makes it for withdrawal and closure,
//! and then the fact names the actor whose claim was overridden and the claim
//! is freed in the same transaction -- a lane left holding a settled task
//! would renew its lease against a row nothing can ever advance. A Design is
//! never concluded over its holder: the holder checkpoints and frees it first.
