//! The record a resident writes into the lock file it possesses.
//!
//! The kernel's answer about the lock says whether some resident is running.
//! It cannot say which one, and that distance is the whole difference between
//! dialling a live surface and dialling an address nobody serves: a resident
//! holds this lock from its first instant, while the discovery records the
//! previous resident published are still on disk and still name the previous
//! resident's generation.
//!
//! So a holder writes down which generation it is, and readers compare. The
//! grammar is stated once here because its two halves live far apart -- the
//! resident writes it from `up`, and clients parse it across a process
//! boundary and an integration-test boundary besides. A reader that restated
//! the grammar and then drifted from the writer would not fail loudly: it
//! would report every live resident as a stranger, and each refusal it raised
//! would look exactly like the defect this record exists to catch.
