//! GIT-08, the landing footprint: a task lands only what it wrote.
//!
//! A task lands as a merge whose first parent is the baseline it integrated
//! against. Every path that merge changes against that baseline has to come
//! from one of the task's own commits. Anything else was already on the shared
//! branch before the task started, which makes it a peer's, and overwriting it
//! here is silent: the landing carries no conflict, no warning, and nothing
//! recording that the replaced content was ever there.
//!
//! A machine merge cannot drift, because merging the baseline with the lane
//! changes only what the lane changed. Hand resolution can, and this port
//! reaches hand resolution by design -- [`super::materialize_conflict`] hands a
//! conflicted tree to the agent and takes back whatever it commits. That
//! returning tree is the one landing nothing else inspects, which is what this
//! boundary is for.
//!
//! Allocator-owned resolution does not make this boundary redundant. It proves
//! that the active claimant owns the handoff, seals the merge controls and
//! resolved index around source evidence, and refuses if either moves. Source
//! evidence proves that the sealed tree is valid; it cannot prove that every
//! valid path in that tree was authored for this task. An unrelated baseline
//! path can be rewritten to other valid content without becoming a conflict or
//! failing any source gate. Only the first-parent landing diff compared with
//! non-merge task commits retains that authorship distinction.
//!
//! The refusal names every drifted path and classifies it, because the two
//! classes need opposite recoveries: a path the baseline still holds is put
//! back by restoring its content, and a path the baseline never had is put back
//! by removing it. A recipe that offered only one of those would be wrong half
//! the time.
//!
//! A resolution can need to adapt a baseline path no task commit names, such
//! as a caller of a function the task changed, and Git admits no non-merge
//! commit while the merge stays open. So a drifted resolution still lands
//! nothing, but it does commit the integration to the lane: the resolved tree
//! with every drifted path held as the baseline has it, unpublished, with the
//! resolved content of those paths left staged. A non-merge commit then owns
//! that content inside the footprint, or a restore from `HEAD` drops it.
