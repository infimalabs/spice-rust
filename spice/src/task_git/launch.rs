//! GIT-04, the launch boundary: advance when it is safe, and never raise.
//!
//! The lenient sibling of [`super::prepare_claim`]. Both apply the same three
//! rules -- a clean tree, no commits ahead, fast-forward only -- but where the
//! claim boundary refuses and stops the caller, this one declines and says why.
//! A lane always starts, and its tree is never mangled or reset to get it
//! there.
//!
//! Every outcome is a note, including the ones that did nothing. Declining to
//! advance is a decision, so it is named rather than left as an anonymous
//! no-op: why a lane is still on an old commit should be answerable from what
//! this boundary returned instead of inferred from where the lane sits. No
//! The resident publishes the exact note in the launch transition and records
//! it with the durable session identity, so a lane that stayed on an old commit
//! says why both immediately and on later reads.
