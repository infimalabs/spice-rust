//! Native guard for Git reference transactions on the current branch.
//!
//! # The refusal can arrive after the worktree is written
//!
//! This guard cannot refuse a destructive rewind before that rewind touches
//! the tree, and no care taken in this module changes it. `reference-transaction`
//! is a *reference* hook: githooks(5) describes it as invoked by commands that
//! perform reference updates, defines its `prepared` state as the point where
//! "all reference updates have been queued to the transaction and references
//! were locked on disk", and scopes an abort to references alone. Git publishes
//! no `pre-reset` hook, so there is no earlier surface for this guard to
//! occupy. A `reset --hard` writes the index and worktree first and only then
//! opens the reference transaction this hook is able to veto.
//!
//! Verified against git 2.50.1 rather than recalled: with this guard installed,
//! a `reset --hard` onto an upstream-merged parent is refused, and leaves HEAD
//! unmoved while the index and worktree hold the abandoned rewind's target
//! content. The branch survives; the tree does not. That asymmetry is why the
//! `ProtectedHistory` refusal reports that the queued target and the current
//! index and worktree agree, but it deliberately prescribes no destructive
//! recovery. That observable state is consistent with `reset --hard` having
//! written the tree, but a soft or mixed rewind can present the same state when
//! the index and worktree already matched its target. The hook is told neither
//! command nor intent, so the operator has to inspect the retained state before
//! deciding what, if anything, to restore.
//!
//! The operational errors cannot finish that state inspection. They therefore
//! report only that the index and worktree may have changed, tell the operator
//! to inspect them after correcting the operational cause, and name
//! `git reset --hard HEAD` only for a command the operator establishes was a
//! destructive rewind. That recovery leaves the reference where it already is,
//! so `abandoned_upstream_commits` finds nothing to protect.
//!
//! That damage is not what every refused command leaves behind, so the refusal
//! reads the state rather than assuming the worst of it. A refused
//! `commit --amend` never wrote the working tree at all, and telling its
//! operator that their files were overwritten would send them to a destructive
//! recovery they do not need. `WorktreeDamage` names which of the two happened
//! and the refusal carries the matching account; the discriminator and its
//! bounds are recorded on `worktree_damage`.
//!
//! Refusing any earlier would mean intercepting the rewind above Git, in a
//! spice-side wrapper for destructive commands. That is a larger design
//! question and is deliberately outside this module. It is recorded here so
//! the next reader of this guard can tell why the refusal arrives when it does
//! without re-deriving Git's hook ordering to reach the same answer.
//!
//! # This guard runs inside a lock every worktree shares
//!
//! `prepared` means the references "were locked on disk", so whatever this hook
//! does, it does while Git holds those locks. One of them is not per-worktree:
//! deleting a reference takes `packed-refs.lock` in the *common* directory, which
//! every linked worktree shares, and an ordinary commit ends with a deletion
//! transaction that clears `AUTO_MERGE`, `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` and `REVERT_HEAD`.
//! Those pseudo-references are normally absent, and deleting an absent reference
//! takes the shared lock anyway.
//!
//! Recorded from a real commit rather than reasoned about, by a hook that logged
//! its state alongside whether the common lock existed: the queue naming
//! `refs/heads/main` was handed over with the lock **free**, and the only queue
//! ever handed over with the lock **held** named `AUTO_MERGE` alone. So the
//! transaction this guard exists to inspect never holds the shared lock, and the
//! transaction that holds it can never contain anything this guard may refuse.
//!
//! That is why [`apply`] reads its own input before it reads Git. Resolving
//! `HEAD`, the publication baseline and the tip the branch holds costs several
//! subprocesses, and for a queue naming no branch every one of them was spent
//! inside the shared lock to reach a conclusion the queue already determined. A
//! queue that names no `refs/heads/` reference is answered from the queue alone,
//! launching nothing.
//!
//! # A successful commit can still report skipped cleanup
//!
//! Git's commit status and its cleanup diagnostic account for different work.
//! Measured on Git 2.50.1, the direct `git commit` can record the requested
//! branch update and exit zero, then exhaust `core.packedRefsTimeout` while
//! deleting an absent pseudo-reference and write an `Unable to create
//! .git/packed-refs.lock` diagnostic to stderr. If the other writer releases
//! the lock within the bound, the same successful commit says nothing about
//! it. A finite bound decides how long Git retries; it cannot guarantee silence.
//!
//! Callers therefore have to read status and both output streams together:
//! zero means the primary commit succeeded, while the diagnostic separately
//! says best-effort cleanup was skipped. A genuine nonzero commit failure keeps
//! its own output. This repository-local hook cannot intercept, suppress, or
//! reinterpret its parent Git process's streams, and it never removes a
//! `packed-refs.lock` owned by another writer.
