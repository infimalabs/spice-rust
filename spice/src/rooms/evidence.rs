//! Bounded evidence one conversation offers to open Design matching.
//!
//! A session's relevant knowledge may sit in any task it finished or in what
//! it said in ordinary conversation, so a session is matched through every
//! retained piece of evidence rather than through one completion document.
//! Each [`Evidence`] card keeps canonical term counts for a few fixed
//! [`View`]s; an [`EvidenceProfile`] scores a Design as the maximum cosine over
//! all views of all cards, under one shared frequency fit, and names the
//! winning card and view.
//!
//! Conversation evidence is authored prose only. Placed protocol headers are
//! cut by the steering grammar, and block quotes, code blocks, raw HTML blocks,
//! and `spice://` quote links are hidden by Markdown structure, so quoted or
//! pasted material never speaks for the author. Inline code stays: an
//! identifier the author names is part of what they wrote. Callers pass only
//! the session's own settled assistant prose; operator and peer turns never
//! become evidence.
