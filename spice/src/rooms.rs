//! Derived task-room participation and listener attention.
//!
//! This module projects presentation state from authorities owned elsewhere. It
//! cannot create claims, lane or team membership, wake permission, task
//! visibility, or browser state. A room is still its anchor task; admitted
//! lane-authored messages and contributions establish participation, not
//! listening. Current work, duties, responsibilities, and recorded Design
//! requests explain why a lane is listening without creating another work
//! lifecycle.
