//! The published discovery record: reading it safely and outlasting its replacement.
//!
//! A resident publishes one document naming the socket it listens on, and
//! holds one lock for as long as it runs. Reading the document is therefore
//! never enough on its own: the bytes of a dead resident are still perfectly
//! well-formed, so every read here is paired with the lock that proves a
//! publisher alive, and with the identities of the file and its parent so a
//! record replaced underneath the client is seen rather than believed.
