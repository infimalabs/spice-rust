//! Seat sweep for endings whose supervisor notice never arrived.
//!
//! A detached supervisor reports its agent ending with one unbound datagram,
//! sent once and never confirmed. When that datagram is lost the durable row
//! stays occupied: every wake for the lane is refused as already occupied,
//! the app keeps showing a running occupant, and only a resident restart
//! would sweep the supervisor state and record the exit. This sweep reads
//! that same state for every seated lane on each reconciliation, so the
//! running resident accounts the ending itself and the wakes the lane was
//! owed fire from the reconciliation that follows. A notice that is merely
//! waiting at the door is not lost: the sweep asks the door first and leaves
//! that seat to the notice arm, which accounts the ending in arrival order.
//!
//! The closing transcript sweep lives here too: whichever path closes a seat,
//! what its occupant wrote last is presented from the same loop turn.
