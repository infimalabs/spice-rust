//! Driving a vendor over its stdin: the opening request, interjected
//! steering, and the close that ends its one turn.
//!
//! A vendor launched over a command stream reads nothing from its arguments
//! after start. The supervisor owns the pipe: it writes the opening request,
//! reads the current authenticated steering inbox through the installed
//! executable when kicked, answers dialogs, and drops the pipe once the
//! admitted prompt has settled so the child drains and exits on its own. A
//! drain interrupts the turn over the same pipe before any signal is sent. A
//! confirm dialog becomes one consent request the resident decides; a call on
//! the lane's shell runs in the lane's own terminal and answers with what the
//! command said; a read of a `spice://` URL answers with the resource it
//! names; every other dialog is declined, since nobody at the lane can compose
//! a choice or text for it.
//!
//! Steering never waits on a command: unheard direction arriving while a
//! command runs interrupts the call, which answers with what the command said
//! so far while the command keeps running as a job. The resident reaches the
//! driver through a datagram signal; the payload remains in journal authority.
