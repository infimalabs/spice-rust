//! Consent requests a lane's occupant raises and the answers that reach it.
//!
//! An omp occupant that opens a confirm dialog holds its turn until someone
//! answers. Its supervisor states the question as one consent request, and
//! the resident records the ask together with what policy makes of it: a
//! grant or a denial answers the dialog at once, while a queue leaves the
//! request to the operator, whose ruling answers it later. Either answer
//! crosses the lane's kick door, and an occupant that has since left took
//! its dialog with it, exactly as it takes a missed inbox kick.
