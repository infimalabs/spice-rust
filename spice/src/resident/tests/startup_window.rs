//! What a client finds between the resident lock and the surface clear.

use super::*;

/// A client standing in the startup window refuses the record it finds there.
///
/// The window is two statements wide. `up` takes the resident lock, and only
/// then removes the discovery records its predecessor left behind, so between
/// those two acts the kernel reports a live holder over an endpoint that
/// belongs to a resident which is already gone. This drives that interval by
/// standing in it: the two production calls run here in order, with a client
/// in between. Nothing is simulated and nothing races — the window is entered
/// by executing its first statement and pausing before its second.
///
/// The predecessor here was killed rather than shut down, which is the only
/// way its record outlives it. That is also what leaves the lock free for the
/// acquisition below to succeed.
///
/// Three arms run against one fixture and one set of published bytes, and the
/// only thing that changes between them is what the lock says about its
/// holder. The middle arm is what makes the first mean something: without it,
/// a client that refused every record would pass. The last arm is what makes
/// the first mean something *else* — a refusal that named the predecessor's
/// death would be reporting a resident that is alive and starting as a corpse,
/// so the two states have to answer differently, from the same record.
