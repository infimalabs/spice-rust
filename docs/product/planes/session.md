# Product model — supporting planes — Session forensics

[Product model — supporting planes](../planes.md) · [Spice product model](../README.md)
## Session forensics

Compaction is the defining constraint. An agent's context is finite and its
history is not, so everything an agent knows about its own past is derived, and
the derivation decides whether it resumes or restarts. The
[session register](../invariants/session.md#session) states the briefing,
history, record, subject, and meter contracts.

### Which plane owns which answer

The transcript is authoritative about what happened and about nothing that is
wanted. Asks come from the steering plane and held work from the board.
Reconstructing intent from prose would read the agent's own restatement of a
directive back to it as the directive.

A `session sweep` row summarizes one compaction window — activity counts and
its latest final answer, never its dialogue — and names the `session turns`
read bounded to exactly that window.

### Recovery coordinates

A task carries coordinates into authorities it never copies. `task show`
renders a `spice session context` command at the task's
[creation boundary](../invariants/session.md#session-task-creation-context-is-immutable-and-source-aware)
and another at the `ClaimWon` that opened the current attempt, a `git show`
command for each recorded claim head or integrated object, and the
[answering session](../invariants/session.md#session-task-show-follows-every-acknowledged-key-to-its-answering-session)
of every acknowledged key. A coordinate that cannot be proved renders its
specific reason instead of a guessed lookup.

Operator steering a lane acknowledges while it holds a task, in any phase,
joins that task's record unless another task cites the key as its origin, in
which case the ask became that task. Peer messages and resident notices never
join. A claim answer resolves the same keys, so the next phase's holder and the
reviewer receive the steering that shaped the work, beside the task room's
newest conversation under the interactive read bounds.

### Message shapes

Every transcript message has exactly one shape — authored ask, scaffolding,
compaction rehydration, or tool-generated envelope — decided structurally from
its own text, so the same text classifies the same way wherever it appears.
Text that is wholly one machine envelope is generated even when its tag is
unknown: the shape is the evidence, not the vocabulary. The briefing, maxims,
and metrics read only authored prose. A rehydration whose intent cannot be
recovered yields an explicit marker, distinct from an empty intent.

### The working-state meter

The meter is one line on the agent's own command stderr, an output stream it already
reads, and it [speaks only when a visible fact changed](../invariants/session.md#session-the-meter-announces-a-durable-state-key-change).
A meter with nothing true to report emits nothing; constant encouragement
would train the reader to skip the stream.
