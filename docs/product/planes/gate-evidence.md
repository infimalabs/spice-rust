# Product model - supporting planes - Gate evidence

[Product model - supporting planes](../planes.md) | [Spice product model](../README.md)

Gate evidence separates proof of one immutable action from admission of one
prospective commit, so work is credited without running tests inside a Git
hook. The digests, store layout, and action declarations live in `gate/src` and
`spice/src/gate_command`.

## Identities

Two identities have different jobs and never substitute for each other.

- `candidate_tree` is the tree of the exact index pre-commit observed. It binds
  an admission to the complete prospective commit and never keys proof.
- `action_key` identifies one action and only the inputs that can change its
  result. Equal keys reuse a receipt across branches and linked worktrees even
  when unrelated paths differ. Branch, commit, and mainline identity enter a key
  only for an ancestry-sensitive action.

Producer, timestamps, and trust standing are credit and authorization metadata;
they never enter an `action_key`, so identical work earns credit wherever it
ran. Reuse requires exact key equality and a canonical receipt from the
proof-aware runner. A shell transcript, test output, a copied exit status, or a
hand-written receipt is not proof: none establishes source, declaration,
command, environment, tool, and result as one execution.

A receipt also carries diagnostics that never enter its `action_key`, input
manifest, or typed result: the lease wait before execution, per-phase wall time
(the app arm's clippy and trunk; a test shard's workspace prebuild and test
execution), Cargo's fresh and rebuilt artifact counts, a bounded tail of the
trunk log, and a producer naming the executing appliance's executable digest,
target, profile, and run. Phase time belongs to the receipt whose execution
spent it, so a prebuild an earlier shard already completed shows as fresh units
rather than a share of that shard's compile. Two receipts that differ only in
diagnostics prove the same thing, and receipts written before diagnostics
existed still decode and reuse.

A packaged toolchain arm's action specification carries the commands its
declaration states, so changing what an arm runs changes its key: the app arm
runs WASM clippy and a development `trunk build` without `--release`, and no
receipt minted when it bundled with `wasm-opt` satisfies it. Optimized bundling
belongs to release and install builds, which keep `--release`.

## Action classes

A `cacheable` action's result is determined by staged content and declared
non-file inputs. An `ancestry-sensitive` action is reusable only with its exact
parent, merge-parent, or committed-baseline identities in its key. A `live-only`
action reads mutable state and runs at pre-commit every time. An action that
cannot prove its complete dependency closure, or name every mutable decision
input, is live-only; it never emits an under-keyed reusable receipt.

## Proof and admission

Pre-commit and bare `spice gate prove` never execute a missing proof. A miss
names each action with its `spice gate prove ACTION` command and one
`spice gate prove --missing` aggregate. Each executed action's complete output
is retained as `.spice/gate-output/DIGEST.log` under the Git common
directory, and a failed action's refusal carries a bounded tail and that path.
A shell pipeline can mask the prover's exit status; preserve the status rather
than inferring success from a filter or the last progress line.

Direct proof and the installed pre-commit hook normalize Git-only routing and
shell prompt metadata before they identify a compiler environment. Windows'
hidden per-drive working directories (`=C:`, for example) are location-only,
like `PWD`, and never partition proof identity. Routing exclusions include
Git for Windows' injected `PLINK_PROTOCOL`. Native `gate pre-commit` removes
every leading copy of `GIT_EXEC_PATH` from `PATH`, accepting both its native
and MSYS spelling, then removes Git's repository-local routing before any
proof environment or child is captured. On macOS it also removes only the
default compiler paths injected by Command Line Tools Git or full Xcode Git;
nondefault and unrelated toolchain paths remain inputs. The same staged action
therefore has one environment identity outside and inside the hook.
Rust and app compile arms use HOME only when the captured compiler environment
supplies it. They neither embed the release builder's home nor synthesize a
runtime replacement; when HOME is absent, Cargo uses its own host resolution
or reports its own failure.

Live Git observations resolve the first regular `git` (`git.exe` on Windows)
on the normalized `PATH` to one absolute executable. A `git-core` entry is used
exactly where `PATH` placed it. Git for Windows' leading `mingw64/bin` and
`usr/bin` still route to that installation's public `cmd/git.exe`; shell-added
user `bin` and public `cmd` routing collapse from environment authority when
that same public directory contains Git. The exact selected Git path and bytes
remain bound separately. A direct producer and Git-invoked hook therefore
select and prove the same tool. Only an absent PATH candidate admits
`/usr/bin/git` on Unix or
`Git\cmd\git.exe`
beneath the shell-resolved Windows Program Files folder, announced with that
path. A selected tool's resolution, launch, or command failure never tries the
platform default. The selected path and executable bytes participate in proof
authority, so changing Git cannot reuse evidence from another tool.

Windows proof environments canonicalize case-insensitive variable names.
Git Bash's `MSYSTEM` terminal defaults, redundant `HOME`/`USERPROFILE`, and
redundant `TMPDIR`/`TEMP` pairs are routing rather than compiler authority, so
the hook consumes the same semantic environment its parent producer supplied.

Pre-commit verifies every owed receipt, runs the live-only checks, and publishes
one admission for the candidate tree. Several admissions may exist for one tree
when branches or worktrees reach equal content from different parents; the
`reference-transaction` hook selects the one whose branch, prior tip, tree,
policy, and gate set all match, and refuses zero or several matches rather than
choosing by recency. Moving a ref within existing history (an unchanged tip, or
a commit already reachable from a local branch, remote-tracking ref, or tag)
needs no admission; rewinds that abandon published history refuse. No
reference-transaction state runs a test or waits for a prover.

## Package declarations

A workspace package whose build script or proc macro runs at compile time is
cacheable only with a closed-world declaration:

```toml
[package.metadata.spice.cargo-proof]
version = 1
complete = true
files = []        # package-relative selected-tree paths
environment = []  # exact ambient variable names
calls = []        # call paths and `.method` names the scanner admits
```

`complete = true` is the package owner's assertion that these lists, extended
by literal `cargo::rerun-if-changed` and `cargo::rerun-if-env-changed` output,
cover every ambient read the compile-time code makes. A missing or incomplete
declaration, a path outside the selected tree, an undeclared read, an
unlisted call the scanner cannot bound, or code that reaches process, network,
or dynamic authority makes the shard non-cacheable.

Rust text no target compiles (parser input, golden samples, corpora a test opens
at run time) is declared as data, and a change under it selects only that
package's own test targets:

```toml
[package.metadata.spice]
data = ["tests/fixture"]
```

A declaration covering source a target compiles refuses. Any other changed Rust
path no target claims refuses, because an unclaimed path is also what a module
the scanner failed to follow looks like. A deleted path that no target claims in
the current or base inventory is treated as data without a declaration.
