## Counsel and mining

[Counsel](../invariants/session.md#session-a-confirmed-maxim-reminder-returns-as-ordinary-steering)
uses ordinary steering. Reports and recurrence mining provide evidence; they
never add, remove, or rescope active tracked bags. Changing active taste requires
an operator-accepted tracked change. Mining clusters recorded, answered operator
corrections and files qualifying proposals on a hidden triage board.

## The three lane-integration git boundaries

Agents never pull or push. Lane integration occurs at launch, claim, and phase
completion; activation is not a fourth boundary. Release, gate, proof, and
installation Git operations have separate owners.

- **Launch:** opportunistic fast-forward. Dirty, ahead, divergent, or unreachable
  lanes keep their work and receive a skip note; failure to advance cannot block
  launch.
- **Claim:** fast-forward-only to the baseline, recording the opening commit.
- **Phase completion:** baseline-first integration, or fast-forward when the
  baseline already descends from the lane.

A content conflict is presented as overlap with the baseline, not as an agent
responsibility to synchronize with an upstream. Typed footprint and admission
refusals remain distinct from raw synchronization failures.

The baseline is the branch the lane's own pairing declares in the repository's
configuration, `branch.<lane>.remote` and `branch.<lane>.merge`, read beneath
the lane's process-local Git shadow; the shadow points an occupant's bare
`git push` and `git pull` at the lane itself and never chooses the baseline. A
pairing on a named remote integrates through that remote's tracking ref; a
pairing on `.` integrates into this repository's own branch with nothing
fetched; a lane that declares no remote takes `origin`, and one that declares no
merge branch takes its remote's HEAD. A declared remote the repository does not
define is a fault; `origin` never stands in for it.

## Landing refusals

A landing may touch only the task's footprint: paths touched by its own
non-merge commits. A merge, including the lane's own integration of the
baseline, never widens it. A refusal names the excess and a repair recipe.

A conflict resolution that drifts outside the footprint publishes nothing, but
it commits the lane's integration of the baseline: the resolved tree with every
drifted path as the baseline holds it. The resolved content of those paths
stays staged, so the claimant either commits it as a non-merge commit that
brings it inside the footprint, such as a baseline caller adapted to a function
the task changed, or restores it from `HEAD`, and then completes again.

When integration synthesizes a tree different from the authored tree, the
configured cheap admission command must accept it before publication. This is
not a rerun of the whole verification suite. A nonempty command captured from
the lane stays fixed through publish-race retries; if the lane declared none,
each integrated tree may introduce its own command. Refusal leaves the
integrated tree at `HEAD` for repair and publishes nothing. Ordinary commit
gating is separate.

A content conflict installs a complete recoverable merge state or leaves the
pre-merge tree untouched, never stranded markers. A publish race preserves peer
paths, re-integrates against the new baseline, and retries within a bound.

## The rewind guard

A checked-out branch reference update cannot abandon commits already merged
upstream. The guard reads the current tip from the ref itself, not the caller's
declared old value.

The upstream is the branch's own local pairing, never an alias, including as a
fallback: process-local configuration can shadow an alias. No named pairing is
different from a named pairing that cannot resolve. Appends give up no history
and pass either way. A non-appending update with an unresolvable named upstream
refuses as unknown rather than clear. Refusal names the commits at risk and
requires forward work rather than amendment or reset backwards.

## Configuration layering

Precedence increases through compiled `builtin`, repository `tracked`,
Git-common machine-local `local`, and per-worktree `worktree` intent. Local and
worktree intent live in Git-directory state, never in the checkout:
`<git-common>/.spice/config.toml` and each worktree's own
`<git-dir>/.spice/worktree.toml`. Tracked `spice.toml` carries
repository policy only; machine-local settings live only in local config, and
per-worktree preferences (model, effort, voices, proof runner) in local or
worktree config. Command flags apply at the command boundary, not as
repository-configuration provenance.

[Provenance](../invariants/session.md#extension-every-effective-configuration-value-carries-its-source-provenance)
and [invalid configuration](../invariants/checks.md#checks-configuration-fails-loudly)
have their homes in the register. [Vendor resolution](../invariants/session.md#extension-vendor-resolution-is-explicit)
is a separate explicit-argument/environment/configuration contract.

## Capability tiers

Observe foreign transcripts; gate repository checks; steer one supervised agent;
or operate a fleet. Each tier is independently usable: a user may stop at any
rung.

Observation initializes nothing: no repository, worktree, team state, claims,
hooks, steering, or supervisor socket. It is read-only and says so.

## Concurrency and serialization

Lifecycle decisions for one lane are serialized to prevent double launch.
Capacity, selection, claim, and start form one serialized decision. Sends within
one lane preserve operator order. Topology mutations carry an observed revision
and refuse a lost race so the client can re-pull. Inbox notices follow committed
mutation and cause fresh authenticated journal reads.

History scans use a resident-wide bounded pool, with queued scans admitted in
arrival order. They run off the async control path; a slow history read must not
block a heartbeat, send, or sibling lane's control operation.

### Stream ordering guarantees

The [stream contract](../invariants/identity.md#identity-a-resume-cursor-belongs-to-one-exact-stream)
owns snapshot, ordering, resumption, and generation/epoch fencing.
