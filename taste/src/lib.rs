//! Configured prose candidates and live reminder identity.
//!
//! This crate selects candidates and mints their stable content and bag
//! identities. It deliberately owns no process: resident recognition decides
//! whether an optional adjudicator sits between a hit and ordinary steering,
//! while a disabled adjudicator preserves the direct deterministic path.
