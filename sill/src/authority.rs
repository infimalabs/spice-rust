//! Owner-private filesystem authority.
//!
//! These operations give callers one permission and publication vocabulary on
//! every release target. A mode is the Unix owner/group/other triplet. On
//! Windows it is projected from the object's discretionary ACL: the owner bits
//! are the access granted to the current token user, and the group and other
//! bits are any access granted to another principal or held through foreign
//! ownership, so a nonzero `0o077` always means another principal can reach the
//! object. Setting a mode there writes one protected owner-only ACL; a directory
//! also carries inherit-only grants equivalent to a `077` umask, so entries
//! created inside a private directory are private. Write access never grants
//! deletion of the object itself; as on Unix, removing an entry is governed by
//! its parent directory's write bit.
//!
//! None of these operations requires elevation or Windows Developer Mode.
